# üìä E-Commerce Transactions Analysis with Google BigQuery

## üìå Overview
This project contains SQL queries used to analyze e-commerce transactions using **Google BigQuery**. The dataset includes customer purchases, store performance, product sales, and revenue insights.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of e-commerce transactions with the following columns:
- `transaction_id` (INT64) ‚Äì Unique transaction identifier
- `store` (STRING) ‚Äì Online or offline store type
- `customer_id` (INT64) ‚Äì Unique customer identifier
- `customer_city` (STRING) ‚Äì City where the customer resides
- `customer_gender` (STRING) ‚Äì Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- `product_id` (INT64) ‚Äì Unique product identifier
- `product_price` (FLOAT64) ‚Äì Price per product unit
- `quantity` (INT64) ‚Äì Number of items purchased
- `total` (FLOAT64) ‚Äì Total transaction amount
- `created_at` (DATE) ‚Äì Transaction date

## üìä SQL Queries
Below are the key SQL queries used for analysis:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Total Transactions Per Store**
```sql
SELECT 
    store,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS average_total,

FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY store
ORDER BY total_transactions DESC;
```
üîπ Displays total transactions, average spending, and unique customers per store.

üîπ Identifies top 10 best-selling products by quantity.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Top 10 High-Spending Customers**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_city,

    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_spent
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_city, customer_gender
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
üîπ Lists the top 10 customers with the highest spending.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Daily Revenue Analysis**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) AS transaction_date,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS daily_revenue,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date ASC;
```
üîπ Tracks daily revenue trends.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Revenue Distribution by Gender**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_gender,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_revenue,
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS average_revenue
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY customer_gender
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
üîπ Compares transaction volume and revenue contribution by gender.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Quantity per Transaction by City**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_city,
    ROUND(AVG(quantity), 2) AS avg_quantity_per_transaction
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY customer_city
ORDER BY avg_quantity_per_transaction DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
üîπ Displays the top 10 cities with the highest average product quantity per transaction.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Most Profitable Products**
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity * (product_price * 0.2)) AS total_profit,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_profit DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
üîπ Identifies the top 10 products generating the highest profit margin.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Monthly Sales Trends**
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions
FROM `ecommerce_transaction.sales`
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year ASC, month ASC;
```
üîπ Shows revenue and transaction trends on a monthly basis.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Inactive Customers (Single Transaction Only)**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_city,
    customer_gender,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_spent,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions
